py2pack
=======

This script allows to generate RPM packages from Python modules. It allows to
list Python modules or search for them on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
Conveniently, it can fetch tarballs and generate spec files as well as
changelogs making it an universal tool to package Python modules.


Prerequisites
=============

py2pack needs the 'argparse' Python module installed. It is also part of
the Python-2.7 Standard Library. Additionally, it uses the Jinja2 templating
engine.


Usage
=====

Suppose you want to package 'zope.interface' and you don't know how it is named
exactly. First of all, you can search for it and download the source tarball if
you found the correct module:

 $ py2pack search zope.interface
 searching for module zope.interface...
 found zope.interface-3.6.1
 $ py2pack fetch zope.interface
 downloading package zope.interface-3.6.1...
 from http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/z/zope.interface/zope.interface-3.6.1.tar.gz
